====== Creating an EC2 Instance on AWS ======

Welcome to this guide on how to create an EC2 instance on AWS! EC2 instances are virtual servers that allow you to run applications in the cloud. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to create your own EC2 instance:

===== Prerequisites =====

Before creating an EC2 instance, you need to have an AWS account. If you don't have one already, you can sign up for free at [[https://aws.amazon.com/|aws.amazon.com]].

You'll also need to have a key pair to connect to your EC2 instance. If you don't have one, you can create a new key pair by following the instructions at [[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html|docs.aws.amazon.com]].

===== Step-by-Step Guide =====

Log in to your AWS account. \\
Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.\\
Click on the "Launch Instance" button.\\
Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) for your instance. This is the operating system that will be installed on your instance.\\
Choose an instance type. This determines the computing resources that will be allocated to your instance.\\
Configure the instance details, such as the number of instances to launch, the VPC and subnet settings, and the storage options.\\
Add tags to your instance for easier management and identification.\\
Configure the security group settings. This determines the inbound and outbound traffic that is allowed to your instance.\\
Review your instance settings and click "Launch" when you're ready.\\
Select your key pair to connect to your instance, and wait for your instance to launch.\\
Congratulations! You have successfully created an EC2 instance on AWS.\\
